                    Their wings are transparent and can seem rainbow-hued when held up to a
                    light source. The veins on the tips of the wings of some cicadas make
                    the shape of a W.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cicadas can live a relatively long time: 4 to 17 years, depending on
                    whether they are annual or periodical cicadas. The periodical cicadas
                    live the longest.

                    They spend most of their lives underground as larvae, followed by a
                    short adulthood — from two to six weeks — above ground, according to the
                    University of Michigan's Museum of Zoology.

                    Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12
                    hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means
                    “black and white cat-foot”.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size
                    of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to
                    eight weeks after birth.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused
                    to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete
                    Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a
                    friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.

                    Washable teddy bears didn't appear until 1954 when the stuffing was
                    switched to an easier to clean nylon fill. Before that, they were
                    stuffed with mohair,
